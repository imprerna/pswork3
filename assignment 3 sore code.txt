Task 1:
1.
Write a function to compute 5/0 and use try/except to catch the exceptions.
def throws():
    return 5/0

try:
    throws()
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print ("division by zero!")
except Exception as err:
    print ('Caught an exception')
finally:
    print('In finally block for cleanup')

2.
Implement a Python program to generate all sentences where subject is in ["Americans",
"Indians"] and verb is in ["Play", "watch"] and the object is in ["Baseball","cricket"].
Hint: Subject,Verb and Object should be declared in the program as shown below.
subjects=["Americans ","Indians"]
verbs=["play","watch"]
objects=["Baseball","Cricket"]
Output should come as below:
Americans play Baseball.
Americans play Cricket.
Americans watch Baseball.
Americans watch Cricket.
Indians play Baseball.
Indians play Cricket.
Indians watch Baseball.
Indians watch Cricket.

subject=["Americans","Indians"]
verb=["play","watch"]
objects=["Baseball","Cricket"]

Syntax = [(Sub+' '+vrb+' '+Objct+".") for Sub in subject for vrb in verb for Objct in objects]
print("Output:")
for syn in Syntax:    
    print(syn)

Task 2:
1.
Write a function so that the columns of the output matrix are powers of the input vector.
The order of the powers is determined by the increasing boolean argument. Specifically, when
increasing is False, the i-th output column is the input vector raised element-wise to the power
of N - i - 1.

import numpy as np
def gen_vander_matrix(ipvector, n, increasing=False):
    
    if not increasing:
        op_matx = np.array([x**(n-1-i) for x in ipvector for i in range(n)]).reshape(ipvector.size,n)
    elif increasing:
        op_matx = np.array([x**i for x in ipvector for i in range(n)]).reshape(ipvector.size,n)
    
    return op_matx
print("------------OUTPUT-------------\n")
inputvector = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
no_col_opmat = 3
op_matx_dec_order = gen_vander_matrix(inputvector,no_col_opmat,False)
op_matx_inc_order = gen_vander_matrix(inputvector,no_col_opmat,True)

print("The input array is:",inputvector,"\n")
print("Number of columns in output matrix should be:",no_col_opmat,"\n")
print("Vander matrix of the input array in decreasing order of powers:\n\n",op_matx_dec_order,"\n")
print("Vander matrix of the input array in increasing order of powers:\n\n",op_matx_inc_order,"\n")

inputvector = np.array([1,2,4,6,8,10])
no_col_opmat = 5
op_matx_dec_order = gen_vander_matrix(inputvector,no_col_opmat,False)
op_matx_inc_order = gen_vander_matrix(inputvector,no_col_opmat,True)

print("---------------------------------------------------------------\n")
print("The input array is:",inputvector,"\n")
print("Number of columns in output matrix should be:",no_col_opmat,"\n")
print("Vander matrix of the input array in decreasing order of powers:\n\n",op_matx_dec_order,"\n")
print("Vander matrix of the input array in increasing order of powers:\n\n",op_matx_inc_order,"\n")
